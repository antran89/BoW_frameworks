The BoW (BoF) frameworks
========================

This folder contains some auxiliary files for the project: 

[] classes of HMDB51 dataset.
[] Matlab script to extract features from [improved Dense Trajectories (iDT)](http://lear.inrialpes.fr/~wang/improved_trajectories) software.
[] A copy of binary executable of iDT (x86_64). However, I modified the code and a new name of binary file. You can download the original software and change the command according to the original name.
